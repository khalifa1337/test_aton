Hello! This is my solution to a test case for ATON company.

Author: Konstantin Makeev

To run:
1) create venv, activate it
2) pip install -r requirements.txt
3) cd currency_exchange/
4) python manage.py runserver 
(Possible bug - when initially loading the data and going to the page with charts, the list of cities is not displayed. Solution - restart the server. idk, it doesn't always show up :(
